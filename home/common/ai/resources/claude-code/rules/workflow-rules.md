# Workflow Rules

## Planning Mode

- Shift+Tab enters plan mode for complex tasks
- For structured projects, use `/gsd:new-project` or `/gsd:plan-phase`
- Explore without modifying files
- Exit plan mode before making changes

## Verification

- Run tests after code changes
- Build after significant changes
- Lint before committing
