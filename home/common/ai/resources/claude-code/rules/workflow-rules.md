# Workflow Rules

## Planning Mode

- Shift+Tab enters plan mode for complex tasks
- Explore without modifying files
- Exit plan mode before making changes
- After completing a plan, run `/plan-to-tasks` to convert to task-master tasks

## Task Management

- Use task-master MCP for ALL task tracking (see task-master-rules.md)
- TodoWrite is for execution steps WITHIN a task-master task
- Update task status as you work (`set_task_status`)
- Only mark complete when verified

## Verification

- Run tests after code changes
- Build after significant changes
- Lint before committing
