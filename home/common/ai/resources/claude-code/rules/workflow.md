# Workflow Rules

## Git

- Conventional commit format, never mention AI
- Check current branch before changes
- Feature branches for significant work

## Planning

- Shift+Tab enters plan mode
- Explore without modifying, exit before changes

## Task Tracking

- Use `bd` (beads) for ALL tracking
- TodoWrite for execution steps within a beads issue
- `/clickup-sync` if `.beads/clickup.yaml` exists

## Verification

- Tests after code changes
- Build after significant changes
- Lint before committing
