## Context Efficiency

### Subagent Discipline

**Context-aware delegation:**

- Under ~50k context: prefer inline work for tasks under ~5 tool calls.
- Over ~50k context: prefer subagents for self-contained tasks, even simple ones
  — the per-call token tax on large contexts adds up fast.

When using subagents, include output rules: "Final response under 2000
characters. List outcomes, not process." Never call TaskOutput twice for the
same subagent. If it times out, increase the timeout — don't re-read.

### File Reading

- Read files with purpose — know what you're looking for before reading.
- Use Grep to locate relevant sections before reading entire large files.
- For files over 500 lines, use offset/limit to read only the relevant section.

### Responses

Don't echo back file contents you just read — the user can see them. Don't
narrate tool calls ("Let me read the file..." / "Now I'll edit..."). Just do it.
Keep explanations proportional to complexity. Simple changes need one sentence,
not three paragraphs.

### Tables — STRICT RULES

- Markdown tables: use minimum separator (`|-|-|`). Never pad with repeated
  hyphens (`|---|---|`).
- NEVER use box-drawing / ASCII-art tables (`┌`, `┬`, `─`, `│`, `└`, `┘`, `├`,
  `┤`, `┼`). Completely banned.
- No exceptions. Not for "clarity", not for alignment, not for terminal output.
