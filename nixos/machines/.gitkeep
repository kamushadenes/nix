# Machine-specific service configurations
# Created by /migrate-lxc command for LXC container migrations
#
# Each file contains service configuration for a specific machine,
# separate from hardware configuration (in nixos/hardware/) and
# sensitive configuration (in private/nixos/).
#
# Example: nixos/machines/postgres.nix contains PostgreSQL service config
